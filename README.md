# 🐍🪜Snakes & Ladders and Monopoly game
In this project we are going to build a simple game application that is a mixture between the Snakes & Ladders and Monopoly games. There are two modes in the game: Design mode is where the user is able to build the playing grid and Play mode is where he plays the game itself. The general idea of the game is four players moving in a grid having snakes, ladders, and Cards. The player goal is to get to the last cell before anyone else. He also takes advantage of the special cells to boost his game and obstruct his opponents. The game ends when a player reaches the last cell.
## 📝Task
we are required to write a C++ code for this Game. we must use object-oriented programming to implement this application.
